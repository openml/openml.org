  mission:
    title: "Machine learning research should be open, well-organized and accessible to anyone."
    text: >
      There is amazing machine learning research going on every day in labs all over the world.
      What if we could easily share the latest great results (datasets, code, experiments) from all of our labs and organize them online,
      so that everyone can easily discover and access them, use them in myriad unexpected ways, and solve problems together on a global scale?
      We strive to make as many datasets as possible easily discoverable, well documented, and frictionlessly accessible.
      When new models are trained and evaluated, we also make these results easily discoverable, clearly documented and reproducible,
      so that we can trust them, learn from them, and build on the combined results of the planet.
      And of course, we use machine learning on top of all this data to make new discoveries and automate our work.
  community:
    title: "From the ML community for the ML community."
    text: >
      We build the tools that we love to use, that empower us as researchers, and make our lives easier.
      Built around open interfaces, OpenML can be used to automatically share (and import) datasets, algorithms, and
      experiments results straight from the tools that we already know and love.
      Through our APIs, OpenML can be easily integrated into new workflows and processes, to import new data and export new results.
      We also believe in great standards for collecting and sharing data and for collecting and analysing experimental results.
  governance:
    title: "Open Source and Open Governance."

      OpenML is being built by an awesome open source community.

      as well as meetings (e.g. hackathons) and online discussions.
      Dedicated contributors can be nominated to become core members, trusted to develop and maintain OpenML with care.
      Core members, in turn, can be nominated for the steering committee, and keep the project running smoothly with the help of the Open Machine Learning Foundation.

      The Open Machine Learning Foundation supports the OpenML project.
      We are open to collaborate and engage with universities, companies, or anyone sharing the same goals and willing to support the project.
      This can involve sponsorship, the co-development of new features, or other forms of partnership, insofar they align with the Foundation's mission and do not affect the independence of the OpenML open source project itself.
  foundation_mission:
    title: "Our mission is to make machine learning simple, accessible, collaborative and open, to enhance and streamline machine learning research, education and skillful practice"
    text: >
      The foundation aims to achieve this mission by, among others, supporting the OpenML.org platform to offer a worldwide community the means to openly share and build upon each otherâ€™s work,
      enhancing collaboration, education, scholarship, openness of data and code, automation of processes, and reproducibility of results.
      We do this in close collaboration with the OpenML community and in accordance with the guiding principles of the OpenML platform, such as the code of honor and the citation policy.
      More generally, we aim to provide the infrastructure, data, code, and scientific foundations necessary to accelerate research for the general benefit of society and to create positive outcomes for future generations.
  foundation_board:
    title: "Foundation Board"
    text: >
      We want to make sure that the money that the foundation receives is invested for the interest of the community.
      For this purpose, we have a board that supervises the activity of the foundation.
      Core contributors to the OpenML project can serve on this board, to make decisions on behalf of the community.
      The current board members are Joaquin Vanschoren, Jan van Rijn, Matthias Feurer, Bernd Bischl, Heidi Seibold, and Giuseppe Casalicchio.

      By joining OpenML, you join a special worldwide community of data scientists building on each other's results and connecting
      their minds as efficiently as possible. This community depends on your motivation to share data, tools and ideas, and to do so
      with honesty. In return, you will gain trust, visibility and reputation, igniting online collaborations and studies that otherwise
      may not have happened.

      By using any part of OpenML, you agree to:  
      * **Give credit where credit is due.** Cite the authors whose work you are building on, or build collaborations where appropriate.
      * **Give back to the community** by sharing your own data as openly and as soon as possible, or by helping the community in other ways.
      In doing so, you gain visibility and impact (citations).
      * **Share data according to your best efforts.** Everybody make mistakes, but we trust you to correct them as soon as possible.
      Remove or flag data that cannot be trusted.
      * **Be polite and constructive** in all discussions. Criticism of methods is welcomed, but personal criticisms should be avoided.
      * **Do not steal** the work of people who openly share it. OpenML makes it easy to find all shared data (and when it was shared),
      thus everybody will know if you do this.
