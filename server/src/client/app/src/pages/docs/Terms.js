                  OpenML follows a standard procedure of using log files, with
                  the sole purpose of improving the user experience. These files
                  log visitors when they visit websites. All hosting services do
                  this as a part of hosting services' analytics. The information
                  collected by log files include internet protocol (IP)
                  addresses, browser type, Internet Service Provider (ISP), date
                  and time stamp, referring/exit pages, and possibly the number
                  of clicks. These are not linked to any information that is
                  personally identifiable. The purpose of the information is for
                  analyzing trends, administering the site, tracking users'
                  usage of the website, and gathering demographic information.
